    "bio": "Hey, what’s up y’all, it’s nice to meet you, but it’s even better to meet me. My name is Eddie Cekici, I have 250 hours in Noteworthy and I specialize in making weird ass noises with my mouth. Noteworthy is a way of life for me. I go in there, do some b’s, maybe some k’s, throw in a couple t’s in there to really get everybody pumped. The chicks go wild. Like feral hogs. Did you know that feral hogs will eat people? Apparently they cause so much agricultural and even property damage that it’s legal in Texas to hunt them from a goddamn helicopter. And they WILL eat human flesh if given the chance. Just like pangolins. Well, I lied about the pangolins, but you believed me, didn’t you? And that’s what really matters, because belief in an assumed truth is stronger than proof of reality, and through this we are able to change not just our perceptions of reality, but reality itself. For example, this tea I’m about to drink is super hot, but if I simply believe it is cold and I down it all in on- oh no oh ow hot hoo boy oh no that no wait no that was supposed to oh god HELP ahhhhh HELP ME PLEASE oh I can feel it making a hole in my throat that’s not good ok hoo ouch ow oh no nope no please I’m sorry anyways this date is going well don’t you agree? no? that’s ok more panda express crab rangoons for me"

    "bio": "For the past two years my Noteworthy bio has been pretty bad, so for this semester’s bio I decided to employ a Professionally Engineered Nanotech Inspired Smachine-learning algorithm that I fed some of Noteworthy’s best bios of the past to make the penultimate bio – and finally make me seem funny.\nHowever, after months of quantum computations, I discovered a grave mistake. Eddie had somehow slipped into the samples and multiplied generation after generation until the computer could only recognize the world through obscure video game references, theater, and albania. Without further ado:\n————————————————————————————————————————————————-\nIntroducing Eddie, a living paradox of quirky charm, proudly representing his Albanian heritage right in the heart of New York. His love life reads like a script torn from a vintage video game, sprinkled with love bites and mysterious red marks.\nSpotlight on Eddie, who steps onto the stage, his Hawaiian shirt one button shy of outrageous, bottle of olive oil in hand.\nEddie: (Eagerly) “Hello, world!”\nHis vampire lover, a figure cloaked in darkness, suddenly lunges at Eddie, leaving cryptic red marks on his neck.\nVampire Lover: (Passionately) Incomprehensible hisses and whispers, followed by a soft, sinister chuckle.\nEddie’s existence is now a peculiar blend of passion and awkwardness. He’s fallen for a vampire, and those enigmatic love bites multiply like bonus points in a retro video game.\nThe stage transforms into a pixelated world, resembling a vintage video game, with love bites appearing as mysterious power-ups.\nNarrator: (Dramatically) “Level up in love, Eddie!”\nSTATS:\nLove Bite Accumulation: Countless\nMysterious Red Marks: A growing collection\nVideo Game References: Rare as legendary loot\nAspirations: Ever-evolving like game expansions\nAs for his life goals, they’re as unique as the storyline of a vintage game. He dreams of becoming a published playwright, but sometimes he takes a dive into the “OH MY GOD SO REDACTED,” like an unexpected twist in a storyline.\nEddie, deep in thought, ponders his aspirations, a cloud of mystery hovering over his dreams.\nEddie: (Contemplative) Muttering to himself, with occasional cryptic whispers.\nAnd in a plot twist that could be straight from a role-playing game, Eddie discovered an ancient Game Boy hidden in an old drawer. Its screen flickered to life, and he embarked on a quest within the pixelated world of “Glover,” as obscure as his vampire lover’s affection.\nEddie’s hands frantically explore the old drawer, and he finds the Game Boy, its screen coming to life in a dramatic, pixelated spectacle.\nNarrator: (Excitedly) “A new quest begins!”\nAs the moonlight bathes their secret rendezvous in an ethereal glow, Eddie serenades his vampire love with verses more poetic than a bard in a fantasy RPG. His heart is a labyrinth, beating to a rhythm known only to them.\nEddie and his vampire lover stand together in the moonlit embrace, the stage set in a surreal and romantic tableau.\nEddie: (Poetically) “In this pixelated love story, we’re the heroes of our own game.”\nAnd now, for a five-line rap to capture the essence of this extraordinary love story:\nEddie and his vampire lover, entwined in an intricate dance, perform a rap with supernatural finesse.\nEddie and Vampire Lover: (Rapping) “Vampire lover, my heart’s undercover, Cryptic red marks, a passion like no other, In the realm of pixels, we found each other, In the game of love, we level up together, Eddie and his vampire, an odd couple, forever.”"

    "bio": "A few years ago, I was driving alone on the highway at cruising speed. The road was straight and the sun was hot, and the moment felt right to sing my heart out. Car singing is way more fun than shower singing because in the car, I really let loose. So I was reaching the climax of a favorite Broadway showstopper, belting with all my heart, when I glanced out my right window. There was a car driving alongside me, and inside was a woman staring at me with an expression that said, “Does he think the car is soundproof?” We locked eyes, sharing the moment when I realized that she was watching me not realize that she heard me. We both looked away quickly. It was awkward for both of us.\nThere has to be a moral to this story somehow. Maybe it’s that singing should be emotive without inhibition. Sing for yourself and sing from the heart. Or maybe the moral is that you should never make eye contact with people because if they’re already looking at you it’ll be twice as awkward as not making eye contact. Yeah, I think that’s the moral."

Here’s my favorite tips.\nYou know when you take photos when you hang out with your friends, and you look back at the photo afterwards and you’re thinking “Damn, I look like rubbish in this photo”? STOP. STOP THINKING THAT. You look hot and sexy. If your friend asked you if they looked good in that same photo, of course you would say they look amazing. So why do you not do the same thing to yourself?? “Treat others the way you want to be treated” my ass. Try reversing that. Give yourself the same respect that you give other people. BE COCKY. It’s hot and shows confidence to other people. Hooray!\nDon’t feel pressured to ever wake up super early in the morning and start your day. Some people can get up at like 5 and finish their day early. It doesn’t work that way for everybody! Everybody’s biological clock is built differently, and we each have different optimal sleep cycles. So if you’re trying your best to start the day at 5 but can never seem to wake up energized, it’s probably not because you’re “unproductive” or “lazy”. You just genuinely aren’t made to do it. If you’re more awake and energized during the later hours of the day, OWN IT. Good for you! Good job!"
